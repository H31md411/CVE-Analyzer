# CVE Analyzer Tool

## Overview

The **CVE Analyzer Tool** provides a user-friendly way to analyze CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and generate detailed reports. 
It leverages advanced language models like OpenAI GPT and LLaMA to assess the impact of CVEs and recommend appropriate remediation actions.

## Features

- **CVE Analysis**: Generate detailed reports on security vulnerabilities.
- **AI Integration**: Use OpenAI GPT and LLaMA for automated analysis.
- **Report Generation**: Save reports as PDF or text files.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI for easy operation.
- **Language Support**: Toggle between English and German for report generation.
- **Recent Reports Management**: Easily access, view, and delete recently generated reports.

## Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets the following dependencies:

**You better want to use a virtual environment ;-)**

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version**: 3.8+
- **Libraries**: Have a look at requirements.tx


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cve-analyzer-tool.git
   

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   
   cd cve-analyzer-tool


3. **Install dependencies:**

Make sure you are in a virtual environment and then run the following command:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. **Configure environment variables:**

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
 
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key


5. **If you would like to use a local hosted LLM with Ollama, the code will check if the LLM is available under:**
   
   model="llama3.1"
   base_url="http://localhost:11434"


## Usage

**Run the following command to start the application:**
python main.py

**Analyze a CVE:**

Enter the CVE ID you want to analyze or select one from the list (the list contains the 10 newest CVE´s found via https://cve.circl.lu/api/last/10
Choose the language model (OpenAI or LLaMA) to use.
Click "Analyze CVE" to generate a report.


**Save the report:**

After the report is generated, you can save it as a PDF or text file by clicking "Save Report."


**Open a report:**

You can select recently generated reports from the list and open them as PDFs.
